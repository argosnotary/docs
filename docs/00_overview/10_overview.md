## Introduction
Argos provides a framework to protect the integrity of a [**software supply chain**](../70_reference/10_terminology#software-supply-chain-or-ssc). It provides a [**REST API**](https://argosnotary.github.io/generated/openapi/) and client libraries in order to protect the integrity of [**artifacts**](../70_reference/10_terminology#artifact) produced by a [**software supply chain**](../70_reference/10_terminology#software-supply-chain-or-ssc).
 
It does so by verifying that each [**step**](../70_reference/10_terminology#step) in the chain is carried out as planned, by authorized systems or personnel, and that the product is not tampered with in transit.

It allows a [**project owner**](../70_reference/10_terminology#project-owner) to create a layout. A [**layout**](../70_reference/10_terminology#layout) lists the sequence of steps of the software supply chain, and the [**functionaries**](../70_reference/10_terminology#functionary) authorized to perform these steps.

When a [**functionary**](../70_reference/10_terminology#functionary) performs a [**step**](../70_reference/10_terminology#step) it gathers information about the related files and sends it to the **Argos Notary Service** in a [**link**](../70_reference/10_terminology#link) metadata file. As a consequence [**link**](../70_reference/10_terminology#link) files provide the required evidence to establish a continuous chain that can be [**verified**](../70_reference/10_terminology#verification) against the steps defined in the [**layout**](../70_reference/10_terminology#layout)

The [**layout**](../70_reference/10_terminology#layout), signed by the [**project owners**](../70_reference/10_terminology#project-owner) together with the links, signed by the designated [**functionaries**](../70_reference/10_terminology#functionary) for a particular [**supply chain run**](../70_reference/10_terminology#scr), can be verified by the service.

This **Overview** is a short description of the system. A complete definition can be found in other parts of the documentation.

## System overview
 
### Involved actors

In the context of Argos Notary, a actor has duties and has to perform a set of actions.

In the description of the actors that follows, it is important to remember that the framework has been designed to allow a large amount of flexibility for many different use cases. Given that every project uses a very specific set of tools and practices, this is a necessary requirement for Argos Notary.

There are three different kind of actors in the framework:

* **Project Owner**: defines the _layout_ of a software _supply chain_.
* **Functionary**: performs a _step_ in the _supply chain_ and provides a signed _link_ as a record that such a _step_ was carried out.
* **Client**: Performs _verification_ on a set of _end products_ by requesting a validation of the set on the Argos Notary Service.

_Layouts_ and _links_ are signed with the private RSA key of the actor.

### Components

Argos Notary has three types of components

* **Argos Notary Service**: An integrated service to store and manage all Argos Notary objects
* **Artifact Collectors**: Services to collect _Artifacts_ in the same as domain as the _Artifact_ store, e.g. Git, Maven...
* **Deployment Verifiers**: Extensions on Deployment Mechanisms to validate end products to deploy.  

### Workflow example

To exemplify the working of the system, we will describe a simple scenario.

Consider a _project owner_, `Alice`, and her five _functionaries_, `Diana`, `Bob`, `Carl`, `Build` and `Client`. 
`Alice` wants `Diana` to write a Python script (foo.py). Then, `Alice` wants `Build` to package the script into a tarball (foo.tar.gz). 
This tarball will be sent to the client, `Client`, as part of the _end product_. `Client` wants to deploy this target file, foo.tar.gz.

`Alice` will create a _layout_ object that will be used by the Argos Notary Service during the _release_ request to make sure of the following:

* That `Bob` and `Carl` approved the script which was written by `Diana`
* That the script written by `Diana` was input for the packaging of the tarball done by Build.
* That the tarball _end product_ is approved by `Alice`.

In order for the Argos Notary Servive to do this, it will need four _link_ objects and the _layout_: first, `Alice’s` _layout_, describing the requirements listed above. 
Then, 2 _link_ objects signed by `Bob` and `Carl` which correspond to the approval of `Diana’s` action of writing a script, 
and a _link_ object signed by `Build` for the _step_ of packaging the script. Finally, there should be a _link_ object, 
including the target file (foo.tar.gz) _artifact_, signed by `Alice` to approve the all _end products_.

When the Argos Notary Service releases this end product on behalf of `Alice`, it will perform the following checks:

1. The _layout_ exists and is signed with a trusted key (in this case, `Alice's`).
2. All _end product_ _artifacts_ match with the expected _end products_ in the _layout_. 
2. Every _step_ in the _layout_ has at least as much as needed corresponding _link_ objects signed by the intended _functionaries_, as described in the _layout_.
3. All the _materials_ and _products_ listed in the _link_ object match, as specified by the _layout_. This will be used to prevent packages from being altered without 
a record (missing _artifacts_ in the _link_ object), or tampered with while in transit. 
In this case, the _products_ reported by Bob should match the _materials_ reported by Build and so on.

If all of these _verifications_ pass, the Argos Notary Service creates and stores a Release Dossier and returns the valid response on the request.

If `Client` wants to verify the validity of the target file it requests a verification of the hash in combination with optionally the domain of 
the Supply Chain. For this request the Argos Notary Service checks the availabillity of the Release Dossier with the hash of the target file with optionally the domain.

## Acknowledgement

Argos Notary is an implementation of or at least inspired by the [in-toto specification](https://github.com/in-toto/docs/blob/master/in-toto-spec.md). 
This is the reason some parts of this documentation are the same as that specification. We couldn't completely refer to that specification 
because there also large differences. We are absolutely gratefull for the inspiration we got from their work.
