## Link

A Link object is created to gather evidence associated with a [Step](20_layout/#step) in the Supply Chain. It is a container with 
`materials` and `products`, which are lists with [Artifacts](#artifact)

After gathering all evidence it is digital signed by the `Functionary` running the step and persisted, together with its [signature](22_signing), in the `Argos Service`.

Every Link has a runId. This runId is as unique as possible to group Links which belong to each other. As an example all Link objects in a 
[LayoutSegment](20_layout/#layoutsegment). A git commit can be used, a timestamp or an application version or something
other which is more or less unique. This used during the [verification process](24_verification).

## Artifact

An `Artifact` is has an uri and the secure hash of the target of the uri. At this moment only files are supported.

### Default exclusion pattern
Gathering of artifacts has the default [glob](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/FileSystem.html#getPathMatcher-java.lang.String-) exclusion pattern `{**.git/**,**.git\\**}`.


## Specification

```
type Link = {
    stepName: String,
    layoutSegmentName: String,
    runId: String,
    materials: Artifact[],
    products: Artifact[]
}

type Artifact = {
    uri: unix file uri,
    hash: sha256 hash
}
```
