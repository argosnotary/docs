## Installation

The collector should be installed in such a way that it could connect to the `XL Deploy` server 
and that the personal user can connect from the browser to the collector service. More information can be found in the 
[Approval Framework page](10_approval_collector).

### Standalone

It is recommended to use the Kubernetes installation for production.

#### Prequisites

* Docker

#### Installation

```shell
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --restart=unless-stopped \
           -e "spring.profiles.active=XLDEPLOY" \
           -e "argos-collector.collectortypes.xldeploy.baseurl=http://xl-deploy-host:4516" \
           --name xldeploy-collector argosnotary/argos-collector-service
```

### Kubernetes

#### Prerequisites

* kubernetes: [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/)
* helm3 3.1+: [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

#### Installation

Add the `argosnotary` Helm repository
```bash
helm repo add argosnotary https://charts.argosnotary.com

```bash
helm install xldeploy-collector argosnotary/argos-collector \
      --set "collector.type=XLDEPLOY,collector.baseurl=http://xl-deploy-host:4516" \

## Configuration

An `approval` in the Argos Notary Service, defined on a `Supply Chain`, has one or more collector definitions. One
of these definitions could be a XL Deploy Collector. 

### Add an XL Deploy Approval

Add a XL Deploy Approval following these steps

1. In the Argos Notary Service go to the `Supply Chain` on which there should be an approval.
2. Right mouse button > choose `Manage Layout`
